MSKS - reproducible task execution
==================================

MSKS (short for Meeseek) is a lightweight Python tool for running interdependent tasks in a reproducible manner. Reproducible environments are created using Conda.
By design MSKS is somewhat aimed at machine learning experiments, although there is a tendency to to keep the system very generic.
