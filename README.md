MSKS - reproducible task execution
==================================

MSKS (short for Meeseek) is a lightweight Python tool for running interdependent tasks in a reproducible manner. Reproducible environments are created using Conda, the source code for the task is pinned to a specific version in a given repository.
By design MSKS is somewhat aimed at machine learning experiments, although there is a design guideline to to keep the system quite generic supporting tasks that may not involve model training.

Concepts
--------

 * Task - A combination of a fixed point in a repository, an entry point and arguments to the entrypoint. Each task is identified by a hash identifier based on these parameters. A task can depend on outputs of other tasks
 * Environment - An Conda environment in which a given task is run in. The environment that is specified by the source code descriptor and is created on demand if needed.
 * Repository / commit: Each task needs a Git repository to get source code from and a specific commit ID to specify which version of the code to use.
 * Entrypoint - One or more ways to interact with the code. Entypoints are described using a description file in the source code which specifies what command is actually run, what arguments are accepted and what outputs are produced.

Installation
------------

You can install MSKS using Pip: `pip install msks`. If successful, you can then use MSKS CLI by executing `msks`.
